## ABOUT THIS FOLDER:
## This folder includes several data analytics explorations using R packages and R datasets.
## This is a portfolio repository providing a glimpse into my R skills. 

## DATA:
## The datasets that have been used are not included as, for a fellow data enthusiast to replicate these results, it is 
## imperative to be comfortable with RStudio (Desktop or web browser version) and then you will be able to access the
## data inside the RStudio console itself.

## CODES:
## The codes are sometimes original sometimes not, but always functional.
## The files with codes have the suffix ".R"

## FIGURES:
## Each code file's figures will have its own folder.
## The folder naming convention used for the figure pdfs is as follows:
## "A_B.pdf" where "A" is the name of the file used to generate the figure and 
## "B" is the type of data representation (histogram or boxplot and so on).
